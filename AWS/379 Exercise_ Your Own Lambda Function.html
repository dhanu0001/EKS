In this exercise, I want to challenge you to be creative and use a lambda function on your own to add a new feature to the SmartBrain app, or your own app. Once you are done, please share it in the Discord <strong>#juniortosenior</strong> channel so the community can see!&nbsp;Just like in the real world, there won't be a solution file for you at the end of this one.&nbsp;It either works or it doesn't.&nbsp;Using all you have learned up to this point, using all of your resources (including our community on Discord).<br><br>You can also find the final front end code&nbsp;with the lambda function you just saw in my videos&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aneagoie/smart-brain-boost-lambda" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;I have also attached the&nbsp;<code>handler.js</code>&nbsp; file from the video to this lecture for your reference.&nbsp;<br><br>As a bonus and if you really want to challenge yourself, try and implement this feature:</p><p><strong>Ability for users to upload new pictures to their profile.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>As an idea, you can use an&nbsp;upload profile button to trigger a lambda function that uploads the image to an S3 bucket where you store user profile pictures. Good luck!<br><br><br></strong></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
