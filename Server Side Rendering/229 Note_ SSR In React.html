There are a ton of articles online that show you how to implement it and you can read those on your own. However, in this course we are going to be <strong>learning about Next.js</strong> which we will cover shortly. In my opinion it is  the preferred way to create a server side rendered app because just like create-react-app, it allows us to focus on the things that matter instead of worrying about configurations that always change and aren't important to your development as a programmer. Stay with me, and I promise it will get more clear how to do SSR properly!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
