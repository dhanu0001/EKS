In the next video we are going to set up our own project using Webpack and other tools that are popular in the industry. However, libraries always change as they get new updates. Since the next video, Babel, Webpack and ESlint have newer versions, so in the video following the next one, I will show you how to update this configuration to work with the latest Babel and Eslint.
