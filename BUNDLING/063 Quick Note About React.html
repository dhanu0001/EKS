I provide the project files at the end of these React videos so if you would like, you can skip over the first few videos, and <strong>go straight to Introduction to Redux + Webpack</strong><br><br><strong>This is only recommended if you have complete The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery OR you have previous experience with React.</strong><br><br>Finally, in this section, I recommend you follow along by also coding with me&nbsp;throughout the React, Redux, and Module Bundling section to get some practice. I provide all the code files at the end of each part so you can go off on your own and practice or add on top of the project.&nbsp;</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
