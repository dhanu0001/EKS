One of the features that has changed is the <code>links</code> property you have seen in previous videos while writing our docker compose file. Links have been replaced by networks. Docker describes them as a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legacy feature that you should avoid using.</a> You can safely remove the link and the two containers will be able to refer to each other by their service name (or container_name). <strong>So in our case all you would need to do is remove the below lines from your Docker Compose file and everything should still work fine</strong>:<br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">    links:<br>      - postgres<br>      - redis</pre><p><br></p><p>By default Compose sets up a single <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">network</a> for your app. Each container for a service joins the default network and is both <em>reachable</em>by other containers on that network, and <em>discoverable</em> by them at a hostname identical to the container name. If you want a custom network, you can use the <code>networks property</code>.<br>If you want to read more about this, you can check out the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official documentation here</a>, or read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41294305/docker-compose-difference-between-network-and-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this stackoverflow answer</a>.<br><br>Don't get too confused by this though. This gets into some really advanced networking that is very specialized. The big takeaway is that you no longer need the links property.</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
